[Riff]

	Come to decide that the things that I tried
	Were in my life just to get high on
	When I sit alone, come get a little known
	But I need more than myself this time
	Step from the road to the sea, to the sky
	And I do believe that we rely on
	When I lay it on, come get to play it on
	All my life to sacrifice

	Hey oh
	Listen what I say, oh

	I got your hey oh
	Now listen what I say, oh, oh

[Riff + keys]

	When will I know that I really can't go
	To the well once more â€“ time to decide on
	When it's killing me, when will I really see
	All that I need to look inside

	Come to believe that I better not leave
	Before I get my chance to ride
	When it's killing me, what do I really need?
	All that I need to look inside

	Hey oh
	Listen what I say, oh
	Come back and hey oh
	Look at what I say, oh

[Simple chords + keys  -  Em G#m Em]

	The more I see, the less I know
	The more I'd like to let it go
	Hey oh
	Who-ho-oh-ho-o

[Powerchords  -  Bm F#m C#m]

	Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
	Where it's so white as snow
	Privately divided by a world so undecided
	And there's nowhere to go
	In between the cover of another perfect wonder
	And it's so white as snow
	Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
	And there's nowhere to go

	Ho!

[2x Riff + keys]

[Riff + keys]

	Went to descend to amend for a friend
	All the channels that have broken down
	Now you bring it up, I'm gonna ring it up
	Just to hear you sing it out
	Step from the road to the sea, to the sky
	And I do believe what we rely on
	When I lay it on, come, get to play it on
	All my life to sacrifice

	Hey oh
	Listen what I say, oh
	I got your hey oh
	Listen what I say, oh

[Powerchords  -  Bm F#m C#m]

	Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
	Where it's so white as snow
	Privately divided by a world so undecided
	And there's nowhere to go
	In between the cover of another perfect wonder
	Where it's so white as snow
	Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
	And there's nowhere to go

	I said hey-hey yeah, oh yeah
	Tell my love now
	Hey-hey yeah, oh yeah
	Tell my love now

	Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
	Where it's so white as snow
	Privately divided by a world so undecided
	And there's nowhere to go

	Where it's so white as snow
	Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
	There's nowhere to go

	I said hey oh yeah, oh yeah
	Tell my love now
	Hey-hey yeah, oh yeah
