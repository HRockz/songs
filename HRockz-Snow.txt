[Riff]

    Come to decide that the things that I tried
    Were in my life just to get high on
    When I sit alone, come get a little known
    But I need more than myself this time
    Step from the road to the sea, to the sky
    And I do believe that we rely on
    When I lay it on, come get to play it on
    All my life to sacrifice

    Hey oh
    Listen what I say, oh

    I got your hey oh
    Now listen what I say, oh, oh

[Riff + keys]

    When will I know that I really can't go
    To the well once more – time to decide on
    When it's killing me, when will I really see
    All that I need to look inside

    Come to believe that I better not leave
    Before I get my chance to ride
    When it's killing me, what do I really need?
    All that I need to look inside

    Hey oh
    Listen what I say, oh
    Come back and hey oh
    Look at what I say, oh

[Simple chords + keys  -  Em G#m Em]

    The more I see, the less I know
    The more I'd like to let it go
    Hey oh
    Who-ho-oh-ho-o

[Powerchords  -  Bm F#m C#m]

    Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
    Where it's so white as snow
    Privately divided by a world so undecided
    And there's nowhere to go
    In between the cover of another perfect wonder
    And it's so white as snow
    Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
    And there's nowhere to go

    Ho!

[2x Riff + keys]

[Riff + keys]

    Went to descend to amend for a friend
    All the channels that have broken down
    Now you bring it up, I'm gonna ring it up
    Just to hear you sing it out
    Step from the road to the sea, to the sky
    And I do believe what we rely on
    When I lay it on, come, get to play it on
    All my life to sacrifice

    Hey oh
    Listen what I say, oh
    I got your hey oh
    Listen what I say, oh

[Simple chords 1  -  Em G#m Em]

    The more I see the less I know
    The more I'd like to let it go
    Hey oh
    Who-ho-oh-ho-o

[Powerchords  -  Bm F#m C#m]

    Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
    Where it's so white as snow
    Privately divided by a world so undecided
    And there's nowhere to go
    In between the cover of another perfect wonder
    Where it's so white as snow
    Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
    And there's nowhere to go

    I said hey-hey yeah, oh yeah
    Tell my love now
    Hey-hey yeah, oh yeah
    Tell my love now

    Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
    Where it's so white as snow
    Privately divided by a world so undecided
    And there's nowhere to go
    Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
    Where it's so white as snow
    Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
    There's nowhere to go

    I said hey oh yeah, oh yeah
    Tell my love now
    Hey-hey yeah, oh yeah
