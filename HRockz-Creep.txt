    When you were here before
                             B
    Couldn't look you in the eye
                        C
    You're just like an angel
                       Cm
    Your skin makes me cry
                     G
    You float like a feather
                   B
    In a beautiful world
                 C
    I wish I was special
                      Cm
    You're so fuckin' special

[Heavy distorted guitar powerchords]

              G
    But I'm a creep
          B
    I'm a weirdo
                             C
    What the hell am I doin' here?
            Cm
    I don't belong here

                       G
    I don't care if it hurts
                 B
    I wanna have control
                     C
    I want a perfect body
                     Cm
    I want a perfect soul
                  G
    I want you to notice
                 B
    When I'm not around
               C
    So fuckin' special
                 Cm
    I wish I was special
