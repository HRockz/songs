VERSE 1:
    When you were here before
    Couldn't look you in the eye
    You're just like an angel
    Your skin makes me cry
    You float like a feather
    In a beautiful world
    I wish I was special
    You're so fuckin' special

CHORUS:
    [2nd guitar powerchords]
    But I'm a creep
    I'm a weirdo
    What the hell am I doin' here?
    I don't belong here

VERSE 2:
    I don't care if it hurts
    I wanna have control
    I want a perfect body
    I want a perfect soul
    I want you to notice
    When I'm not around
    So fuckin' special
    I wish I was special

CHORUS:
    [2nd guitar powerchords]
    But I'm a creep
    I'm a weirdo
    What the hell am I doin' here?
    I don't belong here
