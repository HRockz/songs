[Riff 1]

    Would you know my name?
    If I saw you in heaven
    Would it be the same?
    If I saw you in heaven

[Riff 2]
    
    I must be strong
    And carry on
    'Cause I know I don't belong
    Here in heaven

[Riff 1]

[Riff 1]
    
    Would you hold my hand?
    If I saw you in heaven
    Would you help me stand?
    If I saw you in heaven
    I'll find my way
    Through night and day
    'Cause I know I just can't stay
    Here in heaven
    
[Riff 1]


[unknown]

    Time can bring you down
    Time can bend your knees
    Time can break your heart
    Have you begging please
    Begging please

[Riff 3?]

    Beyond the door
    There's peace, I'm sure
    And I know there'll be no more
    
[Riff 1]

    Tears in heaven
    Would you know my name?
    If I saw you in heaven
    Would you be the same?
    If I saw you in heaven
    
[Riff 2]

    I must be strong
    And carry on
    'Cause I know I don't belong
    Here in heaven
