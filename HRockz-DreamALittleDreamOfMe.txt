[Intro 

[Melody]

    Stars shining bright above you
    Night breezes seem to whisper "I love you"
    Birds singin' in the sycamore trees
    Dream a little dream of me
    
    Say "Night-ie night" and kiss me
    Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
    While I'm alone and blue as can be
    Dream a little dream of me

[Refrain]    
    
    Stars fading but I linger on, dear
    Still craving your kiss
    I'm longing to linger 'til dawn, dear
    Just saying this

[Melody]    
    
    Sweet dreams 'til sunbeams find you
    Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
    But in your dreams, whatever they be
    Dream a little dream of me

[Melody 2 - solo]
    
[Refrain]    
    
    Stars fading but I linger on, dear
    Still craving your kiss
    I'm longing to linger 'til dawn, dear
    Just saying this

[Melody]    
    
    Sweet dreams 'til sunbeams find you
    Sweet dreams that leave all worries far behind you
    But in your dreams, whatever they be
    Dream a little dream of me
    Dream a little dream of me
    Dream a little dream of me
