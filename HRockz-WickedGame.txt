	The world was on fire and no one could save me but you
	It's strange what desire will make foolish people do
	I never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you
	And I never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you

	No, I don't wanna fall in love (this world is only gonna break your heart)
	No, I don't wanna fall in love (this world is only gonna break your heart)
	With you
	With you (This world is only gonna break your heart)

[Advanced strumming]

	What a wicked game you play, to make me feel this way
	What a wicked thing to do, to let me dream of you
	What a wicked thing to say, you never felt this way
	What a wicked thing to do, to make me dream of you

	And I don't wanna fall in love (this world is only gonna break your heart)
	No, I don't wanna fall in love (this world is only gonna break your heart)
	With you
