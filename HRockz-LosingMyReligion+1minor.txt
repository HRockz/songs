INTRO:
    - same as Chorus -

VERSE 1:
    Oh life is bigger                                                 Bbm
    It's bigger than you                                              Fm
    And you are not me                                                Bm
    The lengths that I will go to                                     Fm
    The distance in your eyes                                    Bbm
    Oh no I've said too much                          Fm              D#m
    I set it up                                                       G#

VERSE 2:
    That's me in the corner
    That's me in the spot-light
    Losing my religion
    Trying to keep up with you
    And I don't know if I can do it
    Oh no I've said too much
    I haven't said enough

CHORUS 1:
    I thought that I heard you laughing                     F#
    I thought that I heard you sing                   G#    Bbm  C#   D#sus2
    I think I thought I saw you try                   F#    G#   Bbm  Bbm7  G#

VERSE 3:
    Every whisper, of every waking hour
    I'm choosing my confessions
    Trying to keep an eye on you
    Like a hurt, lost and blinded fool, fool
    Oh no I've said too much
    I set it up

VERSE 4:
    Consider this
    Consider this the hint of the century
    Consider this the slip
    That brought me to my knees, failed
    What if all these fantasies come
    Flailing around
    Now I've said too much

CHORUS 2:
    I thought that I heard you laughing
    I thought that I heard you sing
    I think I thought I saw you try

BRIDGE:
                                                      Bbm   G#   F#maj7  G#
    But that was just a dream                         C#         D#sus2
    That was just a dream                             C#         D#sus2

VERSE 5:
    That's me in the corner
    That's me in the spot-light
    Losing my religion
    Trying to keep up with you
    And I don't know if I can do it
    Oh no I've said too much
    I haven't said enough

CHORUS 3:
    I thought that I heard you laughing
    I thought that I heard you sing
    I think I thought I saw you try

OUTRO:
    But that was just a dream
    Try, cry, fly, try
    That was just a dream
    Just a dream
    Just a dream, dream
